SHORT TERM:

- textarea and edit icon below each image (textarea hides while not editing)
				

			
			
- Update UI to be more streamlined (no redundant interface elements like the collection name at the bottom)
	- create custom menu selector for collections with css + jquery
	
- Update databases so collections AND collection names are all in the one database

- Implement Import/Export collections and entire databases

IN PROGRESS:

- A new UI for adding images and descriptions?
